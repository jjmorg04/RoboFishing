# RoboFishing
 
This was quite the experience... It ended up taking me way longer than I anticipated, and it didn't help that I had a lot of work to do in other classes as well. I apologize for turning this assignment in so late, and I hope you understand my circumstances.

To start, I had an idea way more out of scope than I originally thought. My goal was to create a 1v1 fishing game where players kind of just relax and fish, but try to rack up as many points, which would display on a leaderboard shared across both players. Looking into documentation and utilizing generative AI, I was all over the place. I found myself pulling my hair out trying to figure out why I could see something on one screen, but not in the other. Not to mention I restarted a few times due to file errors and GitHub issues.

Unfortunately, I did not get the end result I was hoping for. I was upset about this for a bit, but I came to the conclusion that with the time that I had and the effort I put in, it just was not within scope for me, and I feel it is a common frustration among other game developers as well.

With that, my end result is a simple game where you catch fish--or at least the hosting player can. I spent countless hours trying to get my catching fish mechanics to work for my client player, but I'm throwing in the towel. It's time to move on, although I'm sure I'll try to fix it in the future. There are lots of bugs, I'm aware, but I like the aesthetic of the game. If I had more time, I think it would be an enjoyable cozy game.

Just so some of my features don't go unseen:
- Host & Client connection ability
- Both players have a fishing pole that can be casted out, and the lines and bobbers, as well as the caught fish appear on both screens
- It was supposed to be pvp, but ended up being a co-op cozy game
- I used lowpoly 3D assets that all fit well together
- Sounds: waves, seagulls, reel spinning, bobber going underwater, motor humming, victory sound when catching a fish

If you read through all of this, I appreciate your thoroughness!
